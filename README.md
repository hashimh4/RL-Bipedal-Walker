# RL-Bipedal-Walker
**Third Year (2022/2023) Reinforcement Learning Module**

Implementation of the actor-critic TD3 model to train a bipedal walker in OpenAI BipedalWalker-v3 environment, with the aim of maximising the reward with the least amount of agent-environment interaction. 

The walker achieves high rewards after 550 episodes to walk fast and fluently on steady terrain.
